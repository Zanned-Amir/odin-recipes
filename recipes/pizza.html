 Mix the salt and flour in a large bowl    
            </li>
            <p>
         <li>
            In a jar or small bowl, mix the water and yeast, and leave it for 5 to 10 minutes.
         </li>   
            </p>
            <li>
                <p>
                Make a well in the centre of the flour. Pour in the water and yeast, and the olive oil. With a wooden spoon or my hand          
            </p></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                mix the liquids into the flour, until forming a ball of dough. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, adding more flour if the dough is too sticky. 
            </p></li>
            <li>
                Put the dough in a large bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave it to raise for 1h30 to 2 hours approximately, in a warm room.
            </li>
